# Registration_Form
Registration Form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
We have a basic registration form that collects a username, email, password, and a confirmation password. The JavaScript code performs some basic validation, such as ensuring that the passwords match. You can add more advanced validation logic as needed based on your requirements.
